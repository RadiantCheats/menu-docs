## Introduction
If you're looking for a top-quality mod menu that delivers unprecedented features and unmatched experience, Stand is certainly a good choice. With its exceptional recovery capabilities, you can quickly give yourself millions and enjoy all the features you need.

Stand is renowned for its impressive stability and performance within the game, customizable options, advanced protection from modder attacks, and user-friendly interface. With the best co-loading compatibility available, you can use Stand simultaneously with any other mod menu. Moreover, it supports LUA Scripts and ASI Mods, enabling you to add an unlimited number of functions to your menu.

Unlike other menus, Stand is polished to perfection, with no bugs or crashes and offers unique features such as Watchdog-style world modification, in-game augmented reality, and a web interface for using the menu from your browser or even your smartphone. It's incredibly easy to install and comes with translation in all languages. Without a doubt, Stand is the most reliable and best option to choose from on the market.

## Setup
1. Go to the Stand [website](https://stand.gg/account/register), and register your license key by entering it and clicking `Register`.
2. Copy your account ID, which is displayed on the website, and back it up in multiple locations. Losing this key will result in losing access to your account.
3. Download the Stand Launchpad after completing all the website's steps, and **run it as an administrator**.
> Before downloading the software, you will need to disable your anti-virus. This is due to the nature of the software and how it interacts with your game. All products sold on RadiantCheats are completely safe and do not contain any form of malicious code.
