## Introduction
[2take1](https://2take1.menu) is the first menu you'll always hear. The fastest to update after a GTA update, this menu offers you the best protections ever present in a menu so that no one out there can mess with you, super stability to keep you engaged for hours, tons of features so that you never get bored in GTA, and so much more! With it's unique Lua Script Engine, you can make and code your own scripts in Lua via which you can add your own features in the menu as well! A menu that cannot be overlooked, 2Take1 is by far one of the best menu on the market that has everything you will ever need in a mod menu.

## Troubleshooting
1. Menu not injecting, or game crashing on inject. 
  - Make sure your antivirus or any real-time protection software (including Windows Defender) isn't blocking anything.
  - Make sure your Windows user has Administrator privileges.
  - Make sure no overlays are enabled, including Discord, Steam, Xbox Game Bar or NVIDIA GeForce Experience.
  - Make sure you have all the correct redistributables installed.
  - Make sure that the 2Take1Menu files are not located in your Desktop or in a folder that syncs to a cloud service, such as OneDrive.
  - Make sure that your Windows username doesn't contain special characters (such as letters with tildes or Russian/Chinese symbols).
  - Perform an integrity check of the game files and make sure no additional stuff is placed there.
  - If you have changed the privileges for the GTA processes, restart your PC. Otherwise, it won't work properly.
  - If you're using Rivatuner, make sure the detection level is set to low or none.

2. The Popstar Launcher is crashing or connecting infinitely.
  - Open a CMD console with admin privileges and type: `net stop npf`

3. There isn't an Inject button. 
  - Press <kbd>-</kbd> on your numpad. Perform an integrity check of the game files. Reinstall the game, if none of the above works.

4. I can't join online lobbies. 
  - Try joining an invite-only lobby first, then a public lobby.
  - Try joining without the menu injected.
  - If it still doesn't work, it's probably an issue with your ISP, so try logging online through a VPN.

5. Authentication failed: Unknown error: deadbeef. 
  - The launcher is having issues to connect with the auth server. Make sure you are using the latest version of the menu, and check your connection status.

6. The Vehicle Spawner shows weird characters. 
  - Set the Renderer to FW1, uninject the menu, and then inject it back.

7. The Lua script isn't working after an update. 
  - The Lua API is usually updated along with the menu. You'll have to update your script to the new functions. If you're not the developer of the script, ask them to do it.

8. The menu is moving on its own. 
  - This happened because you were holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> while pressing a menu key. Release <kbd>Shift</kbd> and press the key that the menu thinks you're pressing, and it should be still again.

9. I can't enter in a spawned vehicle, or it keeps disappearing. 
  - Enable Despawn Bypass and Bypass MP Vehicle Kick.
