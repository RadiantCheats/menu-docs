## More Info

- To load Rebound in GTA V, simply press \"Load\" after having selected the version of the product you would like to use. Make sure you're loaded in story mode when you load your menu in game.
- The key to open the menu is `F4`.
- If an HWID error is displayed upon starting the loader, simply navigate to the `User Panel` tab and press `Reset HWID`.
-  The menu will be downloaded by the loader every time the `Load` button is pressed, there is no need to ever update anything, the loader might have to be re-downloaded in case updates to it are announced, but the menu itself is self-updating, since it's constantly downloaded from the server.
